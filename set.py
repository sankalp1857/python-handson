# A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable 
# (cannot be changed).

# However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

# Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.

# Different types of sets in Python
# set of integers
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)


# set cannot have duplicates
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2}
print(my_set)

# we can make set from a list
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2])
print(my_set)

# set cannot have mutable items
# here [3, 4] is a mutable list
# this will cause an error.
